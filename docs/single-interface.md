# Single Method Interface

This section describes techniques for using single method interfaces.

## Tracker examples

In this example, our goal is to implement ways of tracking movement of things for various action. When we track different actions, we would like the tracker to print messages that are appropriate for different actions.

For example, if we are tracking running actions, we would like the tracking message to say "Person ran from A to B". If we are tracking a driver, we would like the message to say "Person drove from A to B".

Please refer to a working example [here](../examples/ex1/main.go).
